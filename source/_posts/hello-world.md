This is the first post in my blog. I plan to share my idea about programming even if I am a noob LOL. Please feel freely and comment my posts if you have any suggestions.

Because of my poor english, I will write posts in Chinese most of the time. Sorry for the inconvenience.

I am learning HTML+JS and ML now. I can write some Java code. But I havn't tried to build UI on the desktop environment. There is too much things to learn :(
